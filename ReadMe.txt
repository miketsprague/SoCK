Create the environment variable SOCKDIR and set it to a string location of your directory that will hold the game.
Ex: "C:/Users/Mike/Desktop/SoCK"

Run update.exe to get the latest code (and possibly data in the future).

Copy the EsenthelEngine SDK into the root directory of SOCKDIR.
Ex: "C:/Users/Mike/Desktop/SoCK/EsenthelEngineSDK"
